        <h4 id="tittles">Alternative DPS jobs to Bard</h4>
        <div class="mch">
            <img id="mchtwo" src="images/mch.png" alt="Machinist logo">
            <h5 id="tittle">MACHINIST</h5>
            <p>Machinist is one of Bard's ranged-physical DPS brethren. You unlock this class at level 30 in the Heavensward expansion (which you can play for free in the free trial). This is the greediest DPS of the 3 ranged-physicals with only one of it's abilites helping the team. It has a nice, fluent rotation that's simple to pick up and really good DPS when optimized. Also it gets to fire a big fucking drill.</p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="dnc">
            <img id="dnctwo" src="images/dnc.png" alt="Dancer logo">
            <h5 id="tittle">DANCER</h5>
            <p>Dancer is the 3rd brethren of the ranged-physcial DPS and arguably the worst of the three. This is offset by how simple this class is even in comparison to Bard with it specialising in raid-wide party buffs along with it's unique dance partner mechanic, allowing you to super buff one member of your party. It's rotation, like bard, doesn't really exist as it is another proc-based class with it's main reasoning behind playing it over Bard or Machinist being it's ability to super buff one guy with Dance Partner.</p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="sam">
            <img id="samtwo" src="images/sam.png" alt="Samurai logo">
            <h5 id="tittle">SAMURAI</h5>
            <p>Samurai is currently my main class for doing end game content. It's a super fun class that can output a ridiculous amount of damage. It's rotation compared to other melee DPS is on the simpler side of things however this comes at the cost of the class not being the greatest if you aren't all that confident in a fight. It has some great abilities like Midare Setsugekka with a potency of 800 and it's followup to that Kaeshi: Setsugekka with a ridiculous potency of 1.2k. </p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="drg">
            <img id="samtwo" src="images/drg.png" alt="Dragoon logo">
            <h5 id="tittle">DRAGOON</h5>
            <p>Dragoon is a job known for it's ability to slay dragons! (Which probably is why it's called Dragoon.) Much like Samurai, it's rotation is on the simple side when compared to DPS like Monk or Summoner however a lack of complexity doesn't mean a lack of damage. Dragoon can still easily rival it's melee DPS brothers when played optimally. Also you get to backflip to your death sometimes.. Fun! </p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="nin">
            <img id="samtwo" src="images/nin.png" alt="Ninja logo">
            <h5 id="tittle">NINJA</h5>
            <p>Admittedly I don't know all that much about Ninja however from one of my friends I can guarantee two things. One is that this class is difficult to play optimally and two, if you want carpel tunnel early, this is your class. Seriously though Ninja is a great class which provides arguably the best team wide buff which increases the damage your target takes by 5% for 15s. If you don't use trick attack, prepare for your party to be angry.</p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="mnk">
            <img id="samtwo" src="images/mnk.png" alt="Monk logo">
            <h5 id="tittle">MONK</h5>
            <p>Monk is a DPS I'd put on the same pedastel as Ninja in it's complexity and it's ability to give the player carpel tunnel. It has the lowest GCD out of all the DPS (If it doesn't then something's gone wrong) because of it's trait Enhanced Greased Lightning III which reduces your GCD by 20%. This makes it's rotation extremely busy but satisfying to pull off correctly.</p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="rdm">
            <img id="samtwo" src="images/rdm.png" alt="Red Mage logo">
            <h5 id="tittle">RED MAGE</h5>
            <p>Red Mage is the simplest introduction you can have to a caster class with a very easy to understand gauge and a pretty simple rotation to go with it. You build up white and black mana, once you have enough, do melee combo, go back to building white and black mana with spells. Also you get to join Dragoon with the whole backflipping to your death thing.</p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="blm">
            <img id="samtwo" src="images/blm.png" alt="Black Mage logo">
            <h5 id="tittle">BLACK MAGE</h5>
            <p>Black Mage is arguably the hardest class to play optimally in raids due to your knowledge of the fight having to be basically perfect. However this perfection needed to do the damage is well worth the reward with this class being the highest DPS class out there when played optimally. (Samurai sometimes rivals it though.)</p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="smn">
            <img id="samtwo" src="images/smn.png" alt="Summoner logo">
            <h5 id="tittle">SUMMONER</h5>
            <p>Summoner is the class to play if you want to learn a new rotation every time an expansion drops. The current Summoner rotation is the longest rotation in the game by far meaning the skill gap between your average Summoner player and experts of the job is gigantic. However if you are a fan of summoning dragon spirits and a fucking phoenix, this is the class for you with it's overhaul in Endwalker giving it even cooler summons.</p><br>
